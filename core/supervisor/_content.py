    Gemini (and other multimodal LLMs) can return ``content`` as either a

    ``HumanMessage(content=...)`` for the supervisor.

    Rules:
    - ``str`` → returned trimmed.
    - ``list`` → concatenate ``item["text"]`` for each part dict; raw string
      parts pass through. Anything without a ``text`` key is dropped.
    - ``None`` → empty string.
